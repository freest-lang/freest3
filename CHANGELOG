# Version 3.0.0
  - REPL (freesti)
  - New syntax for kinds: 1S and *S for linear and unrestricted session types, 1T and *T for linear and unrestricted functional types
  - Higher-order session types (removed kinds ML and MU)
  - New syntax for functions: 1-> and *-> (or simply ->) for linear and unrestricted functions
  - Pattern matching on function arguments (datatype constructors and internal choices)
  - 'End' type and 'close' function for closing channels
  - Simple module system
  - Shared channels
  - Library functions to work with shared channels
  - Library functions to work with concurrency
  - Primitives for file handling
  - Primitives for handling Standard Input/Output (stdout, stdin and stderr)
  - 'hPut' functions to interact with a shared printing system
  - Builtin support for lists of integers: [], [1,2,3] and (1::2::[])
  - Library functions over lists ('import List')
  - Bug fixes

# Version 2.2.0
  - Fork can be used with and without type parameters
  - Send and receive can be used partially applied
  - Adding collect function (`case collect c of` is the same of `match c with`)
  - New mode with proper syntax-highlighting for emacs
  - Better error messages
  - Warning were added
  - Now we allow the dual of non-recursive variables through co-variables
  - Type abstractions are now values
  - Added a restriction imposing expressions under type abstractions to be values
  - Fixed the associativity of type applications
  - Fixed the Duality for recursion variables
  - New primitive `fix : forall a . ((a -> a) -> (a -> a)) -> (a -> a)`
  - New option -m or --main= that allows to choose the main function to be run
  - New option -q or --quiet that suppresses all warnings
  - Small bug fixes

# Version 2.1.0
  - Fork is now polymorphic
  - Adding options -v,--version and -h,--help
  - Tuning show for recursive and polymorphic types
  - Small bug fixes

# Version 2.0.0
  - Impredicative polymorphism (System F)
  - New kinds that classify types that can be sent in channels (MU and ML)
  - Adding more prelude functions ((^), max, min, succ, pred, abs, quot, gcd,
	lcm, subtract, even, odd, error, id, flip, until, curry, uncurry, swap).
  - Section-like constants for all operators ((+), (*), ...)
  - Proper sections for all operators (except for '-', one should use subtract in this case)
  - Support for more multi-byte unicode symbols
  - Printing boolean/arithmetic/relational operators in the infix way instead of prefix as it previously was.
  - Small bug fixes

# Version 1.0.3
  - Adding String literals
  - Adding printString and printStringLn
  - Adding the & operator.
  - Showing Types and expressions with less parentheses
  - Small bug fixes

# Version 1.0.2
  - Small bug fixes
  - Changing the order of the parameters of send and select functions.
  - Adding the $ operator.

# Version 1.0.1
  - Small bug fixes
  - Fixing error messages for environments. Now, it only shows the different elements between the two environments.
  - Fixing parser and lexer error messages.
  - Adding Ln print versions for basic types, namely, printIntLn, printBoolLn, printCharLn, and printUnitLn
  - Adding a simple mode for emacs and atom
