Streams can be further generalized to a simple form of
processes—functions that accept a number and return a number and a new
process.

-- These should be in the prelude

fst : forall a:TL . forall b:TU . (a, b) -> a
fst p = let (x, _) = p in x

snd : forall a:TU . forall b:TL . (a, b) -> b
snd p = let (_, y) = p in y

type Process = Int -> (Int, Process)

-- Here is a process that, at each step, returns the sum of all the
-- numbers it has been given so far:

sum : Int -> Process
sum acc n = let newAcc = acc + n in (newAcc, sum newAcc)

-- Interacting with processes

curr : Process -> Int
curr p = fst [Int][Process] (p 0)

send' : Int -> Process -> Process
send' n p = snd [Int][Process] (p n)

-- If we send the process p the numbers 5, 3, and 20, the number it
-- returns in response to the last interaction is 28.
main : Int
main = curr (send' 20 (send' 3 (send' 5 (sum 0))))
