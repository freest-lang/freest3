-- We can define two “destructors” for streams; if s is a stream, then
-- hd s is the first number it returns when we pass it unit.

hd : Stream -> Int
hd s = fst [Int][Stream] (s ())

-- Similarly, tl s is the new stream that we obtain when we pass unit to s.

tl : Stream -> Stream
tl s = snd [Int][Stream] (s ())

-- Construct a stream

upFrom : Int -> Stream
upFrom n = (\ _:() -> (n, upFrom (n + 1)))

-- The third element in the upFrom 0 stream

main : Int
main = hd (tl (tl (tl (upFrom 0))))
