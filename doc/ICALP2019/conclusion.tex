\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% Motivated by the need of having a practical and implementable
% algorithm to decide type equivalence on context-free session types, we
% have proposed an algorithm that takes advantage of a process algebra
% graph representation of types to decide type equivalence.
