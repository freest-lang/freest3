\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section, we analyze the performance of our algorithm
to check the equivalence of context-free session types. 
To do so, we have implemented the algorithm we have presented
thus far (sketched in Listings~\ref{lst:toGrammar}, 
\ref{lst:prune}, \ref{lst:algorithm}) 
in Haskell, and used Haskel compiler 
Glasgow Haskell Compiler, GHC version 8.6.3, from which we have 
obtained the running times we present throughout this section.
The machine used for the evaluation was a Mac mini at 3,6 GHz Intel 
Core i3 with 8 GB of memory. 

At this stage, we were aiming to analyze the performance of
our type equivalence checking algorithm, when we came across 
a particular test whose context-free session types where:
\begin{align}
	S \triangleq \mu x . \&\{ \mathsf{add}: x;x; !\,\intk,
							  \mathsf{const}: ?\,\intk;!\in\intk,
							  \mathsf{mult}: x;x;!\,\intk\}

\end{align}
