  % Session types are paramount to describe the structured interaction
  % of processes via typed communication channels; however, they lack an
  % efficient description for serialization of tree-structured data in a
  % type-safe way.
  Context-free session types were proposed as an extension of session
  types able to capture the type-safe serialization of recursive
  datatypes. For the sake of a practical usage, namely in the
  definition of new programming languages, there is an urgent need for
  an algorithm to decide type equivalence. In this work, we propose an
  algorithm to decide type equivalence on context-free session
  types. We prove its soundness and completeness, and validate the algorithm on several examples.
