# A few TODOs

* Support for shared channels
* Introducing the `dualof` operator
* Type inference in limited scenarios, for example in type application `e[T]`
* Type definitions, e.g., `type SendInt = !Integer`.
* Better interoperability with Haskell
* Support for some limited form of Haskell type classes?
* Support for higher-order channels?
* Editor support (Atom, for example)
* Support for other expressions that may be handy when coding: `lambda` abstractions, session initiation.
