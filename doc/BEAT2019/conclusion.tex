% \paragraph{Conclusion and future work}
% \label{sec:conclusion}

% Motivated by the need of having a practical and implementable
% algorithm to decide type equivalence on context-free session types, we
% have proposed an algorithm that takes advantage of a process algebra
% graph representation of types to decide type equivalence. 
This is
ongoing work and we aim to achieve, in the near future, results of
soundness and completeness for the proposed algorithm. Following what
we have already done, we also aim to test this algorithm on larger
examples.
