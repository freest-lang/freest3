  We present an algorithm to decide the equivalence of context-free
  session types, practical to the point of being incorporated in a
  compiler. We prove its soundness and completeness. We also study
  different optimizations that improve the running time and memory
  allocated by more than 1,000,000\%.

  % Session types are paramount to describe the structured interaction
  % of processes via typed communication channels; however, they lack an
  % efficient description for serialization of tree-structured data in a
  % type-safe way.

  % Context-free session types were proposed as an extension of session
  % types able to capture the type-safe serialization of recursive
  % datatypes. For the sake of a practical usage, namely in the
  % definition of new programming languages, there is an urgent need for
  % an algorithm to decide type equivalence. In this work, we propose an
  % algorithm to decide type equivalence on context-free session
  % types. We prove its soundness and completeness, and validate the
  % algorithm on several examples.
