\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have developed a basic compiler for \freest, a concurrent
functional programming with context-free session types, based on the
ideas of Thiemann and Vasconcelos~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/ThiemannV16}.
%
There are many possible extensions to the language. We discuss a
few. Shared channels allow for multiple readers and multiple writers,
thus introducing (benign) races. There are several proposals in the
literature~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/BalzerP17,
  DBLP:conf/sefm/FrancoV13,Lindley.Morris_Lightweight.functional.session.types,DBLP:journals/iandc/Vasconcelos12}
on which we may base this extension.
%
Because \freest{} compiles to Haskell, a better interoperability is
called for. We plan to add primitive support for lists, and for some
functions in Haskell's prelude, in rank-1 functions that do not collide
with linearity constraints.
%
We have chosen a synchronous semantics for the communication
primitives, but we plan to experiment with buffered channels by simply
replacing the back-end.
%
The original proposal of context-free sessions is based on a
call-by-value operational semantics and we kept that strategy in
\freest. We however plan to experiment with call-by-need, taking
advantage of the back-end in Haskell.
