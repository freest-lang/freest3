\begin{abstract}
  \freest{} is an experimental programming concurrent programming
  language. Based on a core functional programming language, it
  features primitives to fork new threads, and for channel creation
  and communication. A powerful type system of context-free session
  types governs the interaction on channels.

  This abstract provides a gentle introduction to the language and
  discusses the compilation process and runtime system.
