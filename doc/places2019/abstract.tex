\begin{abstract}
  \freest{} is an experimental concurrent programming language. Based
  on a core linear functional programming language, it features
  primitives to fork new threads, and for channel creation and
  communication. A powerful type system of context-free session types
  governs the interaction on channels.
  %
  The compiler builds on a novel algorithm for deciding type
  equivalence of context-free session types.
  %
  This abstract provides a gentle introduction to the language and
  discusses the validation process and runtime system.
