\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Session types describe structured communication on heterogeneously
typed channels at a high level.
Their tail-recursive structure imposes a protocol that can be
described by a regular language. 
The types of transmitted values are drawn from the underlying
functional language, abstracting from the
details of serializing values of structured data types.

Context-free session types extend session types by allowing nested
protocols that are not restricted to tail recursion. Nested protocols
correspond to deterministic context-free languages. Such protocols are
interesting in their own right, but they are particularly suited to
describe the low-level serialization of tree-structured data in a
type-safe way.  

We establish the metatheory of context-free session types, prove that
they properly generalize standard (two-party) session
types, and take first steps towards type checking by showing
that type equivalence is decidable.

%  HOW DO WE ORGANISE THE PAPER?

% * 1 - 1.5 pages introduction, perhaps giving some small example already
% * >=2 pages motivation discussing a couple of progressively more complicated examples that highlight that problems and features
% --- do you think a running example is needed? I suppose that technical points can be explained with mini examples made on the spot or by reference to one of the examples from the motivation
% * Then defining formalities
% ** introducing types and type equiv
% ** expressions, statics, and dynamics
% * Then properties (perhaps better interleaved with the formalities)
% ** of types and equivalence
% ** type soundness
% * Then type checking
% ** specification
% ** decidability
% * Conservative extension
% * Related work
% * Conclusion
