Title:

Deciding the bisimilarity of context-free session types

Abstract:

We present a tool to decide the equivalence of context-free session
types and another to decide the bisimilarity of simple grammars.  The
tools are written in Haskell and can be used from the command line or
from a browser (no installation required).

Keywords:

Types, Type equivalence, Bisimulation, Algorithm
