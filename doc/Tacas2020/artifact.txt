Title:

Deciding the bisimilarity of context-free session types

Abstract:

We present an algorithm to decide the equivalence of context-free session types, practical to the point of being incorporated in a compiler. We prove its soundness and completeness. We further evaluate its behaviour in practice. In the process, we introduce an algorithm to decide the bisimilarity of simple grammars.

Types, Type equivalence, Bisimulation, Algorithm
