(Reviewer2) On page 6, definition of word, item 4:  should * on the right hand side be there?

The *l notation is meant to denote a label obtained by concatenating + or & to the label itself. It is important to distinguish +l from &l labels. We will make this clear in the camera-ready.

(Reviewer3) Bisimulation and the description of protocols in concurrent programs

Session types are used to describe protocols in concurrent programs. When incorporated in programming languages, the notion of type equivalence becomes of paramount importance. Due to the characteristics of session types (choice, recursion), bisimulation is a widely used tool to define type equivalence.
