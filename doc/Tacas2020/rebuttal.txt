(Review1, Review3) Concrete comparison of related algorithms

The practical algorithm in the literature that is closer to our proposal is the implementation by Henry and SÃ©nizergues [10] that decides the equivalence of deterministic pushdown automata (DPDAs) by verifying language equality. The experiments section of [10] shows that in several examples the algorithm takes more than one hour to decide the equivalence of two DPDAs. Considering the need to incorporate this functionality in a compiler, this would not be a feasible runtime in a static analysis. Furthermore, the equivalence problem we are dealing with is not the same: deciding the equality of the languages of two DPDAs is not the same problem as deciding the bisimilarity of two DPDAs. For this, consider the DPDA D1 with a single state q and a single loop labeled a to itself, q -a-> q, and the DPDA D2 with a single state p and a single loop labeled b to itself, p -b-> p. The languages generated by both DPDAs is empty, whence L(D1) = L(D2), but they are not bisimilar because D1 has a transition by a and D2 does not. We will clarify these points in a final version of the paper.
The remaining existing implementations do not cover the whole generality of BPAs or simple grammars that we need to handle context-free session types.

(Review2) On page 6, definition of word, item 4:  should * on the right hand side be there?

The *l notation is meant to denote a label obtained by concatenating + or & to the label itself. It is important to distinguish +l from &l labels. We will make this clear in the camera-ready.

(Review3) Kripke structures

Kripke structures have (one or more) labels associated with states and then have (non-labeled) transitions between states.
Labeled transition systems have one label associated with each transition between states (i.e., types or words in a grammar, in our case).
In this sense, the notions of bisimilarity in both cases have some similarities but do not coincide.

(Review3) Bisimulation and the description of protocols in concurrent programs

Session types are used to describe protocols in concurrent programs. When incorporated in programming languages, the notion of type equivalence becomes of paramount importance. Due to the characteristics of session types (choice, recursion), bisimulation is a widely used tool to define type equivalence.
