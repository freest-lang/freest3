Dear all,

We want to announce that FreeST 1.0 is out. FreeST [1] is an
experimental concurrent programming language, based on a core linear
functional language, featuring primitives to fork new threads, and
for channel creation and communication.

The powerful type system of context-free session types, proposed by
Thiemann and Vasconcelos [2], governs the interaction on the
communication channels. Moreover, FreeST builds on a novel algorithm
to decide the equivalence of context-free session types [3].

FreeST is available on your browser at
http://rss.di.fc.ul.pt/tryit/FreeST where a simple tutorial and some
examples are available. The installation details are at
http://rss.di.fc.ul.pt/tools/freest/ together with pointers to other
related tools.

Kind regards, Bernardo Almeida, Andreia Mordido, and Vasco T.
Vasconcelos.
