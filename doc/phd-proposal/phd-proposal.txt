This thesis builds on FreeST, a prototype concurrent functional programming language equipped with bidirectional communication channels governed by context-free session types [A2018,AV2018,AMV2019a]. It aims at proving the effectiveness of context-free session types as abstractions for concurrent programming.

Research will unfold along two axes: the extension of the notion of types and its interplay with polymorphism, and the incorporation of context-free session types in existing programming languages.

For the former, I plan to study an extension of types capable of exchanging arbitrary types ...

For the latter, ...
